# Analysis of longitudinal sequencing of clonal hematopoiesis carriers from Fabre et al. 2021

In this directory are a number of scripts for analyzing the supplementary data from Fabre et al., 2021. 
In particular, we sought to characterize the performance of the statistical model described in
the paper as an estimator of clone fitness. This analysis supports a forthcoming manuscript. 

In `stancode.txt`, we port the Greta model described by the original authors [here](https://github.com/josegcpa/clonal_dynamics/blob/master/Scripts/bb_gene_site_clone_model.R)
to Rstan to faciltate application of the model in other contexts.
